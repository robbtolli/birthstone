== Variables ==

=== Data Types ===
The data types in birthstone are number (float), boolean, and string. To convert between types, read "type conversion" in the "Tips & Tricks" section of this document.

=== Declaring, Initializing, and Assigning Variables ==
Variables must be declaried and initialized before being used (except with the read command as discussed later). To declare and initialize a variable use the initialize operator ( := ). For example,
	number := 0;
	string := "";
	boolean:= false;
declares the variables number, bool, and string, and initializes them to 0, "", and false, respectively.
A variable may be redeclared any number of times -- the variable will simply be bound to a new value.
A variable may also be reassigned using the assignment operator ( = ). When a variable is reassigned (as opposed to redeclared), the variable retains it's old type. Here's an example:
	x := "aa";
	y := "bb";
	x := 1;
	y =  2;

In this example, x is first initialized to "aa", then it is rebound to the value 1 (a number). The variable y is first initialized to "bb", and then *reassigned* to the value 2. Since y is a string, it stays a string when it is reassigned, so the number 2 is converted to the string "2", and y ends up with a value of "2" (as a string).



== Input and Output ==

=== Writing to the console ===
Birthstone has two commands to write to the console: print and write. The difference is that print outputs a newline character after printing the data, while write prints just the data without appending a newline character. Here's an example of the classic "Hello, world" program written in birthstone:
	write "Hello, ";
	print "world!";
This prints out "Hello, world!" to the console, followed by a newline.
Any type of variable, literal, or expression can be printed using the print or write command.

=== Reading from the console ===
To read input from the console, use the read command. The syntax for the read command is read variableName. If you are reading into a variable that has already been declared, the input will be the same type as the variable. If you are reading into a variable that has not been previously declared, a string is read in. Here's an example:
	num := 0;
	str := "";
	bool:= false;

	write "Enter a number: ";
	read num;

	write "Enter a string: ";
	read str;

	write "Enter a boolean: ";
	read bool;

	write "Enter a string: ";
	read var;

This example reads a number into num, a string into str, a boolean into bool, and a string into var (since var hasn't been declared previously). 
	

=== File I/O ===
Birthstone doesn't yet support file I/O. This may be supported in the future.
